# Checkpoint - January 19, 2025

## Resume Phrase
**"Continue from staff hours validation checkpoint"**

## Current State Summary

### What We Completed Today
1. **Staff Management Overhaul**
   - Transformed "Store" tab into "Staff" tab
   - Staff members shown as clickable list items
   - Configuration sections appear when staff member selected
   - Added "Back to Staff List" button with translations

2. **Hours Validation System**
   - Store hours in Settings > Profile are now master hours
   - ALL staff (including owner) must have hours within store hours
   - End time must be after start time
   - Clear error messages when validation fails
   - "Same as store hours" checkbox available for all staff

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Removed customer names from calendar appointment displays
   - Changed "Opens/Closes" labels to "Start/End"
   - Removed "Owner" and "Staff Member" titles under names
   - Fixed immediate translation updates when language toggled
   - Section headers: "Services" and "Staff Hours" properly labeled

4. **Technical Fixes**
   - Made `currentBarberId` global (`window.currentBarberId`) for proper scope
   - Fixed validation logic to actually block saves
   - Added comprehensive Chinese translations
   - Cleaned up debug code
