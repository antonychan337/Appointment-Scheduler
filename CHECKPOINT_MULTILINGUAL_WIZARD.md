**Date:** January 23, 2025
**Commit:** 65c3927

## Resume Phrase
**"Continue from MULTILINGUAL_WIZARD_2025 checkpoint"**

## Current State
- Setup wizard fully functional with Supabase backend
- Bilingual support (English/Chinese) for all services
- Translation fields for both default and custom services
- Active time period validation blocking invalid progressions
- Smart defaults for time periods
- All data flows properly between setup-wizard and owner-app

## Recent Changes Completed

### Translation Features
1. Added translation input fields for all 5 default services:
   - Men's Cut / 男士理发
   - Women's Cut / 女士理发
   - Children's Cut / 儿童理发
   - Hair Coloring / 染发
   - Highlights / 挑染

2. Custom services now have dual-language support:
   - Main input for current language
   - Secondary input for translation (optional)
   - Placeholder shows which translation is needed
   - Visual italic style when no translation provided

### Validation Improvements
1. Fixed "Has active time periods" Chinese translation
2. Added comprehensive validation for active periods:
   - Start time must be before end time
   - No overlapping periods allowed
   - Periods cannot exceed service duration
   - Red border highlighting for invalid inputs

3. Step 4 validation now blocks progression if:
   - Any service with active periods has validation errors
   - Alert shows which service has the issue

### Smart Defaults
- Period 1: 0-15 minutes
- Period 2: Starts 15 min after Period 1 ends
- Period 3+: Continues from previous period
- All defaults respect service duration limits

## Database Schema
- Using Supabase with RLS enabled
- Tables: shops, barbers, services, appointments, bookings
- Authentication via Supabase Auth

## Key Files
- `setup-wizard-app.html` - Main setup wizard with all enhancements
- `owner-app.html` - Owner dashboard
- `customer-app.html` - Customer booking interface
- `supabase-bridge.js` - SharedData API bridge

## Next Steps Suggested
1. Add API-based translation for untranslated service names
2. Implement service category grouping
3. Add service image upload capability
4. Create staff schedule templates
5. Add booking confirmation emails

## Testing Notes
- All translation toggles working correctly
- Validation prevents invalid time periods
- Data persists correctly to Supabase
- Language preference saved and restored
